\description{
This function estimates a low-rank signal from a noisy Gaussian incomplete data using the iterative Adaptive Trace Norm (ATN) algorithm. It can be used to impute a data set.
dl  = dl * max(1-(lambda/dl)^gamma,0). If, the parameters lambda and gamma are not specified,  they are estimated by minimizing a Missing Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE) when the variance sigma^2 of the noise is known or a generalized SURE (GSURE) otherwise.
These SURE and GSURE for missing values are implemented using finite differences.
}
\details{
The iterative ATN algorithm first consists in imputing missing values with initial values.
Then, adashrink is performed on the completed dataset with its regularization parameter lambda and gamma. The missing entries are imputed with the estimated signal. These steps of estimation of the signal via adashrink and imputation of the missing values are iterated until convergence. At the end, both an estimation of the signal and a completed data set are provided. If lambda and gamma are not known, they can be estimated by minimizing SURE when sigma^2 is known. To do this, a grid for gamma is defined in gamma.seq (gammas must be greater than 1) and the Missing SURE function is optimized on lambda using the optim function of the package stats (?optim) with the optimization method by default sets to "BFGS". The initial lambda can be modified in the argument lambda0.
When sigma is not known, it is possible to estimate the two tuning parameters by minimizing Missing GSURE. Note that Missing SURE is defined using finite differences so it is computationally costly.
The estimated low rank matrix is given in the output mu.hat. imputeada automatically estimates the rank of the signal. Its value is given in the output nb.eigen corresponding to the number of non-zero eigenvalues.
